The Framework Universe

An interactive, multi-page website built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project serves as an animated guide to the applications and frameworks of popular programming languages.

Features

Glassmorphism UI: Modern, responsive "frosted glass" theme for all components.

Multi-Page Simulation: A single-page application that seamlessly transitions between the main grid and dedicated "detail" pages for each language.

Interactive Modals: Clickable framework items on each card (and detail page) open a modal popup with a detailed description.

Dynamic Animations:

Cards fade in and slide up on scroll.

Animated bar graphs on detail pages visualize common use cases.

Smooth, animated text gradient on the main title.

Pure JavaScript: All interactivity, page routing, and animations are handled with modern, vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).

Fully Responsive: Designed to look great on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.

Tech Stack

HTML5: For the core structure and content.

CSS3: For all styling, layout (Flexbox/Grid), and animations (Keyframes, Transitions).

JavaScript (ES6+): For all interactivity, DOM manipulation (Intersection Observer), and page/modal logic.

This project was built intentionally without any front-end frameworks like React, Vue, or CSS frameworks like Tailwind or Bootstrap.
